## Overview

tinynet implements a subnet of the [Go `net` package](https://golang.org/pkg/net/). Because it is based on [unisockets](https://github.com/alphahorizonio/unisockets), it supports more platforms (WASM/JS, WASM/WASI, TinyGo, Go etc.) than the official `net` package.

## Usage

Check out [![PkgGoDev](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/alphahorizonio/tinynet)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/alphahorizonio/tinynet) for API documentation. Many examples on how to use it (clients, servers and an example distributed system) can also be found in [the `cmd` package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/alphahorizonio/tinynet/cmd). Additionally, the [`Makefile`](https://github.com/alphahorizonio/tinynet/blob/main/Makefile) might also be of interest; it shows how to build native and WASM binaries.

You want a Kubernetes-style system for WASM, running in the browser and in node? You might be interested in [webnetes](https://github.com/alphahorizonio/webnetes), which supports the unisockets-based networking used by tinynet.
